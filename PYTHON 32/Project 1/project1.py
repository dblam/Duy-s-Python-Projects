# this project is one that can search for files in a directory
# (and all of its subdirectories, and their subdirectories, and so on)
# with interesting characteristics and take some kind of action on those files.

# 10/09/15

# Your program will take input from the console in the following format. It
# should not prompt the user in any way; it should simply read whatever input
# is typed into the console, and you should assume that your user knows the
# precise input format. A description of that format follows.

# 1. The first line of the input is the path to the directory in which the search
# for files should be rooted. For example, a Windows user might type C:\Program
# Files or D:\Python34\Lib, in which case only files in or "underneath" the chosen
# directory will be found.

#   If the first line of the input is not a valid path to a directory (e.g., not a path
#   to a directory that exists, or is not a valid path at all), print the word ERROR on
#   a line by itself and repeat reading a line of input; continue until the input is a
#   valid path to a directory.

# 2. The second line of the input specifies the search characteristics that will be
# used in deciding whether files are "interesting" and should have action taken on
# them. There are three different search characteristics; the second line of the
# input chooses one of them.

#   If the second line of the input begins with the letter N, the search will be
#   for files whose names exactly match a particular name. The N will be followed
#   by space; after the space, the rest of the line will indicate the name of the
#   files to be searched for.

#   If the second line of the input begins with the letter E, the search will be
#   for files whose name end in a particular extension. The E will be followed by
#   a space; after the space, the rest of the line will indicate the desired extension.

#       For example, if the desired extension is py, all files whose names end in .py
#       will be considered interesting. The desired extension may be specified with or
#       without a dot preceding it (e.g., E .py or E py would mean the same thing in
#       the input), and your search should behave the same either way.

#       Note, also, that there is a difference between what you might call a name ending
#       and an extension. In our program, if the search is looking for files with the
#       extension oc, a file named iliveinthe.oc would be found, but a file named
#       invoice.doc would not.

#   If the second line of the input begins with the letter S, the search will be for files
#   whose size, measured in bytes, strictly exceeds (i.e., is greater than) a specified threshold.
#   The S will be followed by a space; after the space, the rest of the line will be a non-negative
#   integer value specifying the size threshold.

#       For example, the input S 2097151 means that files whose sizes are at least 2,097,152
#       bytes (i.e., greater than 2,097,151 bytes) will be considered interesting.

#   If the second line of the input does not match one of the formats described above, print the
#   word ERROR on a line by itself and repeat reading a line of input; continue until the input is
#   a valid path to a directory.


# 3. The third line of the input specifies the action that should be taken on each of the interesting
# files found in the search. No matter what, you should always print the file's path, on its own line
# of output, to the console when you find an interesting one; the action chosen here specifies what
# else should be done with it.

#   If the third line of the input contains the letter P by itself, print the file's path to the
#   console — just as you will always do — but otherwise don't do anything with it.

#   If the third line of the input contains the letter F by itself, open the file under the
#   assumption that the file is a text read, read the first line of text from the file, and
#   print that text to the console. (If the file does not contain text, it's fine if this choice
#   prints unreadable garbage or even crashes your program; testing that a file is a text file is
#   trickier than it sounds, so we'll only test this feature on text files.)

#   If the third line of the input contains the letter D by itself, make a duplicate copy of the file and
#   store it in the same directory where the original resides, but the copy should have .dup
#   (short for "duplicate") appended to the filename. For example, if the interesting file is C:\pictures\boo.jpg,
#   you would copy it to C:\pictures\boo.jpg.dup.

#   If the third line of the input contains the letter T by itself, "touch" the file, which means to modify
#   its last modified timestamp to be the current date/time.
